## üîí Security Best Practices

### Before Deployment
1. **Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Create .env file from .env.example
   - [ ] Generate a new SECRET_KEY
   - [ ] Set DEBUG=False
   - [ ] Configure proper ALLOWED_HOSTS

2. **Database Security**
   - [ ] Use PostgreSQL in production
   - [ ] Set strong database passwords
   - [ ] Enable SSL for database connections
   - [ ] Regular database backups

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - [ ] Configure OAuth properly with production keys
   - [ ] Enable HTTPS for all authentication
   - [ ] Implement proper user permissions
   - [ ] Add rate limiting for login attempts

4. **Static & Media Files**
   - [ ] Serve static files via CDN or nginx
   - [ ] Validate all file uploads
   - [ ] Set proper file permissions
   - [ ] Scan uploads for malware

5. **HTTPS & Security Headers**
   - [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
   - [ ] Configure security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
   - [ ] Use secure cookies
   - [ ] Enable CSRF protection

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Run security audit tools
- [ ] Update all dependencies
- [ ] Test with DEBUG=False
- [ ] Configure logging properly
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is working
- [ ] Check security headers
- [ ] Test OAuth flow
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Set up regular security updates

## üìù Regular Maintenance

### Weekly
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Check for security updates
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts

### Monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Review user permissions
- [ ] Audit database access logs
- [ ] Test backup restoration

### Quarterly
- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Update documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Recommendations

### Security Scanning
- `bandit` - Python security linter
- `safety` - Check dependencies for vulnerabilities
- `django-defender` - Brute force protection

### Monitoring
- Sentry - Error tracking
- New Relic - Performance monitoring
- ELK Stack - Log analysis

### Testing
- `pytest-django` - Testing framework
- `coverage` - Code coverage
- `selenium` - End-to-end testing
