## How to Apply This Migration

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
1. rename_organisation_type_column.sql
2. frontend/update_organization_types_table_complete.sql
3. verify_organisation_type_migration.sql (to verify)
```

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend
All frontend code has been updated. Deploy your Next.js application with the updated code.

### Step 3: Verify
Run the verification queries in `verify_organisation_type_migration.sql` to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Key Features

✅ **Backward Compatible**: The old `type` column is maintained for compatibility  
✅ **Auto-Population**: `Organisation_Type_Name` is automatically populated based on code  
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Indexes created on both new columns  
✅ **IATI Compliant**: All 16 standard IATI organization types included  
✅ **Safe Migration**: Idempotent - can be run multiple times safely  
✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Verification queries included  
✅ **Enhanced UX**: Dropdown shows both code and name (e.g., "10 - Government")  

## API Changes

### Request Format (when creating/updating organizations)
```json
{
  "name": "Example Organization",
  "Organisation_Type_Code": "40",
  // Organisation_Type_Name is auto-populated
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "name": "Example Organization",
  "Organisation_Type_Code": "40",
  "Organisation_Type_Name": "Multilateral",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Separate code and name columns make the data structure clearer
2. **Performance**: Indexed columns improve query performance
3. **Completeness**: All IATI standard types are now supported
4. **Consistency**: Frontend and database aligned on naming conventions
5. **Maintainability**: Type names are automatically managed

## Testing

After migration, test these critical paths:
- [ ] Organizations list page loads
- [ ] Create new organization
- [ ] Edit existing organization  
- [ ] Filter by organization type
- [ ] XML import with organization data
- [ ] Participating organizations in activities
- [ ] Analytics/reports using organization types

## Rollback

If needed, rollback instructions are provided in `ORGANISATION_TYPE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`.

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `verify_organisation_type_migration.sql` results
2. Review browser console for frontend errors
3. Verify database migration completed successfully
4. Ensure frontend deployment includes all updated files
