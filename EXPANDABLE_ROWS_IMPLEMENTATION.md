## User Experience

### Collapsed State (Default)
- Clean, compact table view
- Chevron pointing down (‚ñº)
- Shows only essential columns
- Easy to scan

### Expanded State
- Chevron pointing up (‚ñ≤)
- Additional row appears below with light gray background
- Shows detailed information in organized two-column grid
- Doesn't interfere with sorting, filtering, or other table functions

### Interaction
- Click chevron icon to toggle expansion
- Each row expands/collapses independently
- State is maintained while browsing (until page refresh)
- Click doesn't interfere with edit/delete actions
- Works in both read-only and edit modes

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [expandedRows, setExpandedRows] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

const toggleRowExpansion = (rowId: string) => {
  setExpandedRows(prev => {
    const newSet = new Set(prev);
    if (newSet.has(rowId)) {
      newSet.delete(rowId);
    } else {
      newSet.add(rowId);
    }
    return newSet;
  });
};
```

### Table Structure
```tsx
<React.Fragment key={itemId}>
  {/* Main Row */}
  <TableRow>
    <TableCell>
      <Button onClick={() => toggleRowExpansion(itemId)}>
        {isExpanded ? <ChevronUp /> : <ChevronDown />}
      </Button>
    </TableCell>
    {/* ... other columns */}
  </TableRow>
  
  {/* Expandable Detail Row */}
  {isExpanded && (
    <TableRow className="bg-muted/20">
      <TableCell colSpan={columnCount}>
        {/* Detail content in two-column grid */}
      </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  )}
</React.Fragment>
```

3. **Better Scannability**: Easier to review many transactions/budgets/disbursements
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced/technical fields hidden until needed
5. **Consistent UX**: Same pattern across all three financial tables
6. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation works
7. **Mobile Friendly**: Expandable content stacks well on smaller screens
