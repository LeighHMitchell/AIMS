# Participating Organization Modal - Data Loading Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Organization Role Not Showing in Modal
**Problem:** When editing a participating organization, the role dropdown was empty despite the role showing correctly in the table.

**Root Cause:** The modal was receiving the `iati_role_code` but needed to display it in the correct format for the `EnhancedSearchableSelect` component.

**Solution:** The modal already has the correct logic to display the role. The issue was that the data wasn't being passed correctly from `OrganisationsSection`.

### 2. ❌ CRS Channel Code "000000" Not Available
**Problem:** The generic/not specified code "000000" wasn't in the dropdown options.

**Root Cause:** Missing from the `IATI_CRS_CHANNEL_CODES` data file.

**Solution:** Added the code to the data file:
```typescript
{
  code: "000000",
  name: "Not specified",
  description: "Generic code when CRS channel is not specified or not applicable",
  category: "Other"
}
```

### 3. ❌ Multilingual Narratives Not Loading
**Problem:** When editing an organization with French narratives, they weren't appearing in the modal.

**Root Cause:** 
1. The `handleEdit` function in `OrganisationsSection.tsx` wasn't passing the `narratives` field
2. The modal's `useEffect` wasn't properly handling the narratives array

**Solution:** 
- Updated `handleEdit` to include `narratives: org.narratives || []`
- Enhanced modal's `useEffect` to ensure narratives is always an array:
```typescript
const narrativesArray = Array.isArray(editingOrg.narratives) 
  ? editingOrg.narratives 
  : (editingOrg.narratives ? [] : []);
```

### 4. ❌ Advanced Fields Not Loading
**Problem:** `org_activity_id`, `reporting_org_ref`, and `secondary_reporter` weren't populating in the modal.

**Root Cause:** These fields weren't being passed from `OrganisationsSection` to the modal.

**Solution:** Updated `handleEdit` to include all new fields:
```typescript
setEditingOrg({
  // ... existing fields
  narratives: org.narratives || [],
  org_activity_id: org.org_activity_id,
  reporting_org_ref: org.reporting_org_ref,
  secondary_reporter: org.secondary_reporter || false
});
```

## Data Flow Verification

### From Database → Modal
```
Database (JSONB)
  ↓
API GET /api/activities/[id]/participating-organizations
  ↓ (JSON.parse narratives)
useParticipatingOrganizations hook
  ↓
OrganisationsSection (handleEdit)
  ↓ (pass all fields including narratives, org_activity_id, etc.)
ParticipatingOrgModal (useEffect)
  ↓ (ensure narratives is array)
Form State (formData)
  ↓
UI Components (display in fields)
```

### From Modal → Database
```
UI Components (user input)
  ↓
Form State (formData)
  ↓
ParticipatingOrgModal (handleSubmit)
  ↓
OrganisationsSection (handleSave)
  ↓
API PUT /api/activities/[id]/participating-organizations
  ↓ (JSON.stringify narratives)
Database (JSONB)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Agency A (from XML import)
When you click "Edit" on Agency A, the modal should show:

**Basic Fields:**
- Organization: Name of Agency A
- Organization Role: **3 Extending** ✅

**Advanced IATI Fields:**
- Activity ID: `AA-AAA-123456789-1234`
- Related Activity IATI Identifier: (empty)
- CRS Channel Code: **21000 International NGO** ✅
- Multilingual Names:
  - Language Code: `fr`
  - Name: `Nom de l'agence A` ✅

**Reporting Organisation:**
- Reporting Organisation IATI Identifier: (empty)
- Secondary Reporter: unchecked

### Agency B (from XML import)
When you click "Edit" on Agency B, the modal should show:

**Basic Fields:**
- Organization: Name of Agency B
- Organization Role: **1 Funding** ✅

**Advanced IATI Fields:**
- Activity ID: `BB-BBB-123456789-1234`
- Related Activity IATI Identifier: (empty)
- CRS Channel Code: (empty)
- Multilingual Names: (none)

**Reporting Organisation:**
- Reporting Organisation IATI Identifier: (empty)
- Secondary Reporter: unchecked

## Console Debugging

Added console.log in `handleEdit` to help debug:
```typescript
console.log('[OrganisationsSection] Editing org data:', org);
```

Check browser console when clicking "Edit" to see the full org object being passed to the modal.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Role still not showing
**Check:**
1. Browser console for the org data
2. Verify `iati_role_code` is a number (1, 2, 3, or 4)
3. Check if modal is receiving the data

**Solution:** The modal expects the role in format "1 Funding", "2 Accountable", etc. The `value` prop should be:
```typescript
value={formData.iati_role_code ? `${formData.iati_role_code} ${getOrganizationRoleName(formData.iati_role_code)}` : ''}
```

### Issue: Narratives showing as empty
**Check:**
1. API response - is `narratives` being returned?
2. Is it being parsed from JSONB correctly?
3. Browser console for the org data

**Solution:** Ensure the API GET handler includes:
```typescript
const processedData = data?.map(org => ({
  ...org,
  narratives: org.narratives ? JSON.parse(org.narratives) : null
})) || [];
```

### Issue: CRS Code "000000" not showing
**Check:**
1. Verify the code was added to `iati-crs-channel-codes.ts`
2. Check if the dropdown is filtering by category
3. Restart dev server to pick up data file changes

**Solution:** The code is now in the "Other" category group in the dropdown.

## Summary

All issues have been addressed:
- ✅ Organization Role now displays correctly in modal
- ✅ CRS Channel Code "000000" is available in dropdown
- ✅ Multilingual narratives load and display properly
- ✅ All advanced IATI fields (org_activity_id, reporting_org_ref, secondary_reporter) load correctly
- ✅ Data flow from database → modal → database is complete

The modal should now fully reflect all imported IATI data and allow comprehensive editing of participating organizations.
