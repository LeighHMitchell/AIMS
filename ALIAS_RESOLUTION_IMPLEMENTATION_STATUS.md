- [x] **TypeScript types updated** - Added alias fields to all relevant interfaces

## üîÑ Integration Steps (Next Phase)

The following steps are **defined in the plan** but not yet implemented. These will integrate the alias resolution system into the actual IATI import workflow:

### Step 10: Update IATI Parse Route
**File:** `frontend/src/app/api/iati/parse/route.ts`

**What needs to be done:**
- After parsing activities, collect all unique organization references from:
  - `participating-org` elements (all roles)
  - `reporting-org` elements
  - `provider-org` in transactions
  - `receiver-org` in transactions
- For each unique (ref, narrative) combination:
  - Call `/api/organizations/resolve` endpoint
  - Mark as `matched: true` if found
  - Add to `unresolvedOrganizations` array if not found
- Return enhanced structure with `unresolvedOrganizations` field

### Step 11: Update IATI Import Page UI
**File:** `frontend/src/app/iati-import/page.tsx`

**What needs to be done:**
- After parsing step, check if `unresolvedOrganizations.length > 0`
- Show warning banner: "X organizations need to be resolved before import"
- Auto-open `ResolveOrganizationModal`
- Disable "Import" button until all resolved or skipped
- Store resolutions in state
- When user clicks "Import":
  - For resolutions with `rememberMapping: true`, call API to update organization aliases
  - Log all resolutions to `organization_alias_mappings` table
  - Proceed with normal import using resolved organization IDs

### Step 12: Update Activity XML Import Tab
**File:** `frontend/src/components/activities/XmlImportTab.tsx`

**What needs to be done:**
- Apply same resolution flow as full import
- Scope to single activity context
- Use `ResolveOrganizationModal` component

## üìã Testing Checklist

Before deploying, test the following:

### Database Tests
- [ ] Run all three migrations successfully
- [ ] Verify indexes are created correctly
- [ ] Test fuzzy matching function with sample data

### API Tests
- [ ] Test `/api/organizations/resolve` with various inputs:
  - [ ] Exact match by IATI ID
  - [ ] Match by alias_refs
  - [ ] Fuzzy match by name
  - [ ] Fuzzy match by name_aliases
  - [ ] No match scenario
- [ ] Test `/api/organizations/resolve-batch` with multiple orgs
- [ ] Test alias validation prevents conflicts
- [ ] Test audit log creation and retrieval

### UI Tests
- [ ] Add aliases via Edit Organization modal
- [ ] Verify aliases display on organization profile
- [ ] Test StringArrayInput edge cases:
  - [ ] Duplicate detection
  - [ ] Empty string handling
  - [ ] Long strings
  - [ ] Special characters
- [ ] Test ResolveOrganizationModal:
  - [ ] Link to existing org
  - [ ] "Remember mapping" checkbox
  - [ ] Create new org
  - [ ] Skip org
  - [ ] Progress tracking
  - [ ] Validation messages
  - [ ] "Skip All" button

### Integration Tests (After Steps 10-12)
- [ ] Import IATI XML with unrecognized organizations
- [ ] Resolve organizations and verify import succeeds
- [ ] Verify aliases are added when "Remember mapping" is checked
- [ ] Verify audit log entries are created
- [ ] Re-import same file and verify auto-recognition works

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL Editor or CLI
   frontend/supabase/migrations/20250201000000_add_organization_aliases.sql
   frontend/supabase/migrations/20250201000001_create_alias_mappings_log.sql
   frontend/supabase/migrations/20250201000002_create_fuzzy_match_function.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Backend Code**
   - All API routes are in place
   - No additional backend configuration needed

3. **Deploy Frontend Code**
   - All components are ready
   - No environment variables needed

4. **Test Core Functionality**
   - Add aliases manually via Edit Organization modal
   - Test fuzzy matching via API
   - Verify profile display

5. **Complete Integration** (Steps 10-12)
   - Integrate with IATI parse route
   - Update import page UI
   - Update activity import tab

6. **Full System Test**
   - Import real IATI file with inconsistent org references
   - Verify resolution workflow
   - Verify automatic recognition on re-import

## üìù Known Limitations

1. **Manual Integration Required:** Steps 10-12 need to be completed to integrate with IATI import flow
2. **No Admin Panel Yet:** Centralized alias management view is a future enhancement
3. **No Bulk Import:** CSV upload for multiple aliases not implemented
4. **No Auto-Suggestion:** System doesn't proactively suggest likely matches

## üéØ Success Metrics

Once fully integrated, success can be measured by:
- **Reduced Duplicates:** Fewer duplicate organizations created during imports
- **Faster Imports:** Less manual intervention needed for org resolution
- **User Adoption:** Number of aliases added by users
- **Resolution Rate:** Percentage of orgs auto-resolved vs manual
- **Audit Trail:** Complete history of all resolutions

**Status:** Core implementation complete ‚úÖ  
**Next:** Integrate with IATI import flow (Steps 10-12)  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours for integration + 2-3 hours for testing
