# IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## The Issue
Your debug logs aren't appearing, which means the updated code isn't running.

## Fix This Now:

### Step 1: Stop Everything
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in your terminal to stop the dev server
```

### Step 2: Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Hard Refresh Browser
- Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Firefox: `Ctrl+F5`

### Step 5: Verify Updates Loaded
Open browser console and type:
```javascript
// You should see this message if code is updated
console.log("TEST: If you see this, console is working");
```

### Step 6: Test Contributors
1. Go to Contributors tab
2. Open browser console
3. Select an organization
4. Click "Nominate"
5. **YOU MUST SEE**: `[CONTRIBUTORS DEBUG] Nominating contributor:`

## If Still No Debug Logs:

### Option A: Force Rebuild
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### Option B: Check for Errors
```bash
# Look for build errors
npm run lint
```

### Option C: Verify File Changes
Check that these files were updated:
- `frontend/src/components/ContributorsSection.tsx` (line ~75 should have console.log)
- `frontend/src/app/activities/new/page.tsx` (line ~480 should have updateContributors function)

## What You Should See

After following these steps, when you add a contributor:
```
[CONTRIBUTORS DEBUG] Nominating contributor: {...}
[CONTRIBUTORS DEBUG] Current contributors before: []
[CONTRIBUTORS DEBUG] Updated contributors: [{...}]
[CONTRIBUTORS DEBUG] onChange called with 1 contributors
[AIMS DEBUG] updateContributors called
```

## Report Back

Please confirm:
1. ✅ Dev server restarted?
2. ✅ Browser hard refreshed?
3. ✅ Do you see ANY `[CONTRIBUTORS DEBUG]` messages?
4. ✅ Do you see ANY `[AIMS DEBUG]` messages?

If NO to #3 or #4, the code isn't updated and we need to troubleshoot the build process.
