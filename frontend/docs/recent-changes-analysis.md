# Recent Changes Analysis & Issues Report

## 🔄 What Changed Recently

### 1. **IATI Compliance Migration**
We updated the database to follow international aid standards (IATI). This means:

**Field Name Changes:**
- `title` → `title_narrative` 
- `description` → `description_narrative`
- `created_by_org` → `reporting_org_id`
- `partner_id` → `other_identifier`
- `iati_id` → `iati_identifier`

**Removed Fields:**
- `objectives` (not part of IATI standard)
- `target_groups` (not part of IATI standard)

**New Fields Added:**
- `created_by_org_name` - Organization name displayed in UI
- `created_by_org_acronym` - Organization acronym

### 2. **API Route Updates**
Updated all API endpoints to handle the new field names by creating "mapping layers":
- When fetching data: Database fields → Frontend fields
- When saving data: Frontend fields → Database fields

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Transaction Type Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Database expects IATI codes ('2' for Commitment) but code was sending old codes ('C')
**Error Message:** `invalid input value for enum transaction_type_enum: "C"`
**Fix Applied:** Updated `/api/organizations/summary` to use '2' instead of 'C'

### Issue #2: Empty Activity Fields ✅ FIXED  
**Problem:** When editing activities, title and description were empty
**Root Cause:** 
1. API wasn't mapping `title_narrative` → `title`
2. Activity detail page was fetching from wrong endpoint
**Fix Applied:** 
1. Updated field mappings in `/api/activities/[id]`
2. Fixed fetch URL from `/api/activities` to `/api/activities/[id]`

### Issue #3: Port Conflicts ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Multiple dev servers trying to run on ports 3000-3010
**Fix Applied:** Killed all processes and started fresh server

## 🔍 Potential Issues to Watch

### 1. **Legacy Transaction Types in Scripts**
**Location:** `/scripts/generate-myanmar-activities.ts`
**Issue:** Still uses old transaction codes ('C', 'D', 'E', 'R')
**Impact:** Any generated test data will have invalid transaction types
**Recommended Fix:** Update to use IATI codes ('2', '3', '4', '7')

### 2. **Incomplete Field Mappings**
Some API routes might still be missing field mappings. Watch for:
- Activities showing as "undefined" or empty
- Missing organization names
- Transaction data not loading

### 3. **Database Migration Not Yet Applied**
The IATI compliance migration SQL exists but needs to be run in Supabase:
- File: `frontend/sql/migrate_activities_iati_compliance.sql`
- Status: Ready but not yet executed in production

## 📋 Quick Reference: Transaction Type Mapping

| Old Code | IATI Code | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| C | 2 | Outgoing Commitment |
| D | 3 | Disbursement |
| E | 4 | Expenditure |
| IF | 12 | Incoming Funds |
| R | 7 | Reimbursement |

## 🛠️ Recommended Actions

1. **Update Test Data Generators**
   - Fix `generate-myanmar-activities.ts` to use IATI codes
   
2. **Audit All API Routes**
   - Check for any remaining uses of old field names
   - Ensure all routes have proper field mapping

3. **Add Data Validation**
   - Add frontend validation to prevent sending old transaction codes
   - Add better error messages when validation fails

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Document the new field names for other developers
   - Create migration guide for existing data

## ✅ What's Working Now

- Activities can be created and edited with proper field mapping
- Title and description fields are properly saved and loaded
- Organization summary no longer throws transaction type errors
- Development server is running cleanly on port 3000

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. Run the IATI compliance migration in your Supabase database
2. Test all activity CRUD operations thoroughly
3. Update any remaining scripts or utilities using old field names
4. Consider adding automated tests for field mappings
