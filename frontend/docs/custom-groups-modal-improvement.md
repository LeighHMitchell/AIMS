# Custom Groups Modal Improvement

## Overview
The "Create Custom Group" experience has been improved by replacing the full-page form with a modal dialog and enhancing the organization selection UX.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modal Implementation
- **Component**: `frontend/src/components/organizations/CreateCustomGroupModal.tsx`
- Replaced the full-page form at `/partners/groups/new` with a modal dialog
- Modal is now accessible via buttons on:
  - `/partners/groups` page
  - `/organizations` page (in the Custom Groups tab)

### 2. Organization Selection Improvements

#### Display Format
Organizations now display as: **"Full Name (Acronym)"**
- Example: "Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)"
- If no acronym exists, shows just the full name
- Uses `full_name` field if available, otherwise falls back to `name`

#### Enhanced Multi-Select
- **Searchable**: Search by organization name or acronym
- **Visual Badges**: Selected organizations appear as removable badges
- **Wider Dropdown**: 600px width to show full organization names
- **Scrollable List**: Uses ScrollArea for better navigation
- **IATI ID Display**: Shows IATI organization ID when available

#### Validation
- Requires at least one organization to be selected
- Shows error toast if no organizations are selected

### 3. User Experience Improvements

#### Visual Feedback
- Selected organizations count: "3 organizations selected"
- Clear display of all selected organizations as badges
- Each badge shows the full "Name (Acronym)" format
- Easy removal with X button on each badge

#### Success Flow
- On successful creation:
  - Shows success toast: "Custom group created successfully with organizations assigned!"
  - Closes the modal
  - Refreshes the groups list
  - Organizations are automatically saved to the join table

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### API Integration
- Uses existing `/api/custom-groups` POST endpoint
- Sends `organization_ids` array with the request
- Backend automatically creates entries in `custom_group_memberships` table

#### State Management
- Modal state managed in parent components
- Form state reset on successful submission
- Organization list fetched when modal opens

## Usage

### Opening the Modal
```typescript
const [createModalOpen, setCreateModalOpen] = useState(false)

// Open modal
<Button onClick={() => setCreateModalOpen(true)}>
  Create New Group
</Button>

// Render modal
<CreateCustomGroupModal 
  open={createModalOpen}
  onOpenChange={setCreateModalOpen}
  onSuccess={fetchGroups}
/>
```

### Organization Display Logic
```typescript
const getOrganizationDisplay = (org: Organization) => {
  const displayName = org.full_name || org.name
  return org.acronym ? `${displayName} (${org.acronym})` : displayName
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Better Flow**: No page navigation interruption
2. **Clear Selection**: See all selected organizations at once
3. **Professional Display**: Full names with acronyms for clarity
4. **Immediate Assignment**: Organizations assigned on group creation
5. **Responsive Design**: Modal works on mobile/tablet views

## Migration Notes
- The old page at `/partners/groups/new` still exists but is no longer linked
- Can be removed in a future cleanup
- All functionality has been preserved in the modal
