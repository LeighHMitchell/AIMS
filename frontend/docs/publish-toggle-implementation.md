# Publish Toggle Implementation

## Overview
As of 2025-07-02, the publish functionality has been converted from a button to a toggle switch for better UX.

## Changes Made

### Previous Implementation
- Green "Publish Activity" button in the footer
- Required clicking the button to publish
- No visual indication of current publication status in header
- Save status indicators showed saving progress

### New Implementation
- Toggle switch in the header
- Shows "Unpublished" on left, "Published" on right
- Green color when published
- Instant visual feedback of publication status
- **Save status indicators removed** for cleaner UI
- **Larger toggle** with bold labels for better visibility

## Location
The toggle is positioned in the activity editor header:
- In the top right area of the header
- Only visible to users with publish permissions
- Only shown when editing an existing activity (not on create)

## Functionality
- **Toggle On**: Publishes the activity immediately
- **Toggle Off**: Currently shows info toast (unpublishing not yet implemented)
- **Disabled States**: 
  - When activity title is empty
  - During save/publish operations
  - For users without publish permissions

## Visual Design
- Uses ShadCN Switch component
- **Larger size**: 125% scale for better visibility
- **Bold text labels**: Increased from regular to semibold
- **Increased spacing**: Gap of 4 units between elements
- Green background when published
- Gray text labels on either side
- Consistent with other UI elements

## Benefits
1. **Better Visibility**: Always see publication status
2. **Faster Access**: No need to scroll to footer
3. **Intuitive**: Toggle clearly shows on/off state
4. **Space Saving**: Removes large button from footer
