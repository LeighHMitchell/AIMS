# Simplified Publishing Requirements

## Overview
As of 2025-07-02, the requirements for publishing an activity have been simplified to make the system more user-friendly.

## Changes Made

### Previous Requirements
- Activity Title (required)
- Activity Partner ID (required)
- Activity Status (required)  
- Planned Start Date (required)
- Valid Sector Allocation (100% total required)

### New Requirements
- **Activity Title only**

## Benefits
1. **Faster Publishing**: Users can publish activities with minimal information
2. **Iterative Approach**: Activities can be published early and updated later
3. **Reduced Friction**: Removes barriers to getting activities into the system
4. **Flexibility**: Organizations can define their own internal validation processes

## Technical Changes
1. Removed sector validation check from publish button
2. Removed sector validation from saveActivity function
3. Simplified auto-save required fields to only Activity Title
4. Updated documentation to reflect new requirements

## Note
While only the Activity Title is technically required for publishing, organizations should still strive to complete all relevant fields for data quality and IATI compliance. The system now allows flexibility in when this information is added.
