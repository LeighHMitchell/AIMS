# 🚀 **SETUP COMMENTS DATABASE - STEP BY STEP**

## **The Problem:**
You're seeing "Failed to add comment" because the database tables for the enhanced comments system don't exist yet.

## **The Solution:**
Run the database setup script in your Supabase dashboard.

---

## **Step 1: Access Your Supabase Dashboard**

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your AIMS project
4. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

---

## **Step 2: Run the Complete Setup Script**

1. **Copy the entire contents** of `frontend/activate-advanced-comments.sql`
2. **Paste it** into the SQL Editor
3. **Click "Run"** to execute the script
4. **Wait for completion** (should take 10-30 seconds)

---

## **Step 3: Verify Setup**

After running the script, you should see:
- ✅ **Success message**: "🎉 ADVANCED COMMENTS SYSTEM ACTIVATED SUCCESSFULLY!"
- ✅ **4 new tables created**: `activity_comments`, `activity_comment_replies`, `comment_reactions`, `comment_notifications`
- ✅ **Multiple functions created**: For reactions, search, notifications
- ✅ **All indexes created**: For performance

## **Step 4: Test the Comments**

1. **Refresh your browser** at `http://localhost:3001`
2. **Go to any activity** and open the Comments panel
3. **Try posting a comment** - it should work now!
4. **Test reactions** - click thumbs up/down, heart, etc.
5. **Test mentions** - type `@` to mention users
6. **Test attachments** - click the paperclip icon

## **What This Creates:**

### **Tables:**
- `activity_comments` - Main comments with context linking
- `activity_comment_replies` - Threaded replies
- `comment_reactions` - Thumbs up/down, heart, celebrate, confused
- `comment_notifications` - Real-time notifications

### **Features:**
- ✅ **Reactions** (👍👎❤️🎉😕)

## **Troubleshooting:**

### **If you get errors:**
1. **Check Supabase connection** - Make sure you're in the right project
2. **Check permissions** - Ensure you have admin access
3. **Try running in parts** - Split the script if needed

### **If comments still don't work:**
1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Restart your dev server** after database changes
