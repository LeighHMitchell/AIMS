# Supabase Migration Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### 1. Data Migration
- **Partners**: 5 partners successfully migrated
- **Activities**: 15 activities successfully migrated (with transactions and sectors)
- **Activity Logs**: Structure ready (existing logs didn't have required fields)

### 2. API Routes Updated to Supabase

All main API routes now use Supabase instead of JSON files:

| Route | Status | Features |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `/api/activities` | ‚úÖ Updated | Create, Read, Update, Delete activities with transactions and sectors |
| `/api/partners` | ‚úÖ Updated | Full CRUD operations for partner organizations |
| `/api/activity-logs` | ‚úÖ Updated | Activity logging with role-based filtering |
| `/api/projects` | ‚úÖ Updated | Project management with similarity detection |

### 3. File Backups

Old file-based routes have been backed up as `*.file-based.ts` in case you need to reference them.

## üîÑ How Data Flow Works Now

1. **Frontend** ‚Üí Makes API calls to Next.js API routes
2. **API Routes** ‚Üí Use `supabaseAdmin` client to query Supabase
3. **Supabase** ‚Üí Stores data in PostgreSQL with proper relationships
4. **Response** ‚Üí Data is transformed to match frontend expectations

## üìù Important Notes

### Field Mappings
Some fields are mapped between frontend and database:
- Activities: `title` ‚Üî `title` (no change)
- Projects: `title` ‚Üî `name` (mapped)
- All dates: Empty strings converted to `null` for PostgreSQL

### UUID vs String IDs
- Old system used simple string IDs (e.g., "1k82s")
- Supabase uses UUIDs (e.g., "a4630d8-1407-4ab7-86dc-82ec0ae421fd")
- New records will have UUIDs

### Foreign Key Relationships
During migration, invalid foreign keys were set to `null`:
- `partner_id` references
- `created_by_org` references
- `user_id` references

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Authentication
Set up Supabase Auth to properly track users:
```typescript
// Example: Set up auth in your app
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'

const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
```

### 2. Fix Organization References
Create organizations in Supabase and update activities with proper `organization_id` values.

### 3. Real-time Features
Enable real-time subscriptions for live updates:
```typescript
// Example: Subscribe to activity changes
supabase
  .channel('activities')
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'activities' }, payload => {
    console.log('Change received!', payload)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

### 4. File Storage
For images/documents, use Supabase Storage instead of base64:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('activity-images')
  .upload('banner.jpg', file)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If you see 404 errors:
- Check that all API routes have been switched to Supabase versions
- Ensure your `.env.local` has correct Supabase credentials
- Restart the dev server after environment changes

### If data doesn't appear:
- Check Supabase dashboard Table Editor
- Verify Row Level Security policies
- Check browser console for specific errors

### To revert to file-based storage:
```bash
# Restore original routes
mv src/app/api/activities/route.ts src/app/api/activities/route.supabase.ts
mv src/app/api/activities/route.file-based.ts src/app/api/activities/route.ts
# Repeat for other routes
```

## üéâ Benefits You Now Have

1. **Scalability**: Handle thousands of records efficiently
2. **Reliability**: Automatic backups and high availability
3. **Security**: Row Level Security and proper authentication
4. **Performance**: Indexed queries and optimized database
5. **Real-time**: Capability for live updates (when implemented)
6. **Relationships**: Proper foreign keys and data integrity
