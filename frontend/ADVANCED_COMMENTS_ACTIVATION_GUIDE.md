-- Run this file: frontend/supabase/migrations/20250117000000_create_enhanced_comments_system.sql
```

### 2. Reactions System
```sql
-- Run this file: frontend/supabase/migrations/20250118000000_add_comment_reactions.sql
```

```sql
-- Run this file: frontend/supabase/migrations/20250117130000_add_archive_columns_to_comments.sql
```

## 🎯 **How to Use the Advanced Features**

### Option 1: Use Enhanced Activity Editor (Recommended)
```tsx
import { EnhancedActivityEditor } from '@/components/activities/EnhancedActivityEditor';

<EnhancedActivityEditor 
  activityId="your-activity-id"
  initialData={{
    title: "Activity with Advanced Comments",
    description: "Fully featured activity editor"
  }}
/>
```

### Option 2: Use Standalone Enhanced Comments
```tsx
import { EnhancedActivityComments } from '@/components/activities/EnhancedActivityComments';

<EnhancedActivityComments
  activityId="your-activity-id"
  contextSection="basic_info"  // Links comments to specific sections
  contextField="title"         // Links to specific fields
  allowContextSwitch={true}    // Allow users to change context
  showInline={false}           // Full drawer mode vs inline
/>
```

### Option 3: Add Context-Aware Comment Buttons
```tsx
import { ContextAwareCommentTrigger } from '@/components/activities/ContextAwareCommentTrigger';

<ContextAwareCommentTrigger
  section="finances"
  field="budget"
  onTrigger={(section, field) => openComments(section, field)}
  variant="button"  // 'button' | 'icon' | 'inline'
  showCount={true}
  commentCount={5}
/>
```
