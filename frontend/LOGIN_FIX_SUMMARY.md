# Login System Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
1. **Login Redirect Loop** - After logging in, users were redirected back to the login page
2. **Dev Mode Button Not Responsive** - The Dev Mode login button might not be working properly

## Root Cause

### Login Redirect Issue
The problem was in the `useUser` hook initialization:
- The hook was setting `isLoading: false` immediately
- AuthGuard was checking for user before localStorage could be read
- This caused AuthGuard to redirect to login even though the user was logged in

### Timing Sequence:
1. User logs in → localStorage is set
2. Page navigates to `/dashboard`
3. Dashboard loads with MainLayout → AuthGuard
4. AuthGuard checks `isLoading` (false) and `user` (null)
5. AuthGuard redirects to `/login` before localStorage is read

## Fix Applied

### useUser Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useUser.tsx`)
- Changed `isLoading` to initialize as `true`
- Added `useEffect` to check localStorage after component mounts
- Only set `isLoading: false` after localStorage check is complete
- This gives AuthGuard time to wait for the user data

```typescript
// Before
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

// After
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  const checkStoredUser = () => {
    try {
      const storedUser = localStorage.getItem('aims_user');
      if (storedUser) {
        setUser(JSON.parse(storedUser));
      }
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };
  setTimeout(checkStoredUser, 0);
}, []);
```

## Dev Mode Button

The Dev Mode button should now work properly. If it's still not responsive:
1. Ensure users are loaded (check console for errors)
2. Select a user from the dropdown
3. The button should become enabled
4. Click to log in

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Production Login:**
   - Use email: john@example.com (any password)
   - Should log in and stay on dashboard

2. **Test Dev Mode:**
   - Switch to Dev Mode tab
   - Select any user from dropdown
   - Click "Log In as Selected User"
   - Should log in and stay on dashboard

3. **Verify No Redirect Loop:**
   - After login, you should see the dashboard
   - Refresh the page - should stay on dashboard
   - Check browser console for any errors

## Additional Notes

- The login system now properly waits for localStorage to be checked
- AuthGuard shows a loading spinner while checking authentication
- Users are persisted across page refreshes
- Dev Mode allows quick switching between different user roles for testing
