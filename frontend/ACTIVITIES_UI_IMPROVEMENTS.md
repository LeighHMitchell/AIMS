# Activities UI & UX Improvements - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED CHANGES**

### üü¶ **1. Redesigned Summary Cards**

**File**: `frontend/src/components/ActivitySummaryCards.tsx`

- **Replaced** 8 complex cards with **3 focused cards**
- **New hierarchy format**: Filtered count (primary) ‚Üí "Filtered" label ‚Üí System-wide count ‚Üí "All [Type]" label
- **Typography**: 
  - Filtered value: `text-2xl font-semibold`
  - Labels: `text-sm text-muted-foreground`
- **Card layout**: 3-column grid (`md:grid-cols-3`) with consistent `rounded-lg` styling

#### Card Definitions:
1. **Total Activities** (LayoutGrid icon)
   - Shows filtered vs all activities count
2. **Activity Status** (Workflow icon) 
   - Shows filtered vs all activity statuses (Planning/Implementation/Completed/Cancelled)
3. **Publication Status** (Eye icon)
   - Shows filtered vs all publication states (Draft/Published)

### üìÑ **2. Activity Table Cleanup**

**File**: `frontend/src/app/activities/page.tsx`

- **Removed** all UUID references from activity rows
- **Cleaned up** table display to show only relevant information:
  - **Activity Title** (bold, clickable)
  - **Created By** (organization name, muted text)
  - **Partner ID** and/or **IATI ID** (if available, labeled clearly)
- **Updated** search placeholder from "UUID" to "Partner ID, IATI ID"
- **Improved** visual hierarchy with proper spacing

### üìù **3. Save vs Publish Behaviour**

**File**: `frontend/src/app/activities/new/page.tsx`

- **Save Button**: Changed from `saveActivity({ goToList: true })` to `saveActivity({})`
  - Now **stays in the Activity Editor** after saving
  - Shows "Activity saved successfully!" toast
  - Perfect for iterative editing workflow

- **Publish Button**: Unchanged `saveActivity({ publish: true, goToList: true })`
  - **Redirects to Activity List** after publishing
  - Shows "Activity published successfully!" toast
  - Clear completion of workflow

## üéØ **USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Enhanced Workflow**
- **Save**: Quick saves with immediate feedback, stays in context
- **Publish**: Final action with clear completion signal (redirect)

### **Cleaner Data Presentation**

- Focus on business-relevant identifiers (Partner ID, IATI ID)
- Better visual hierarchy in activity rows

### **Improved Dashboard**

- Focused information architecture (3 cards vs 8)

## üîß **Technical Details**

- Maintained responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Preserved existing functionality while improving UX

### **State Management**
- Activity filtering state properly reflected in summary cards
- No breaking changes to existing data flows
- Preserved all search and filter functionality

The Activities interface now provides:
- **Clear visual hierarchy** with focused summary cards
- **Clean, professional** activity list without technical clutter

- **Consistent design language** using shadcn components throughout

All changes maintain backward compatibility and preserve existing functionality while significantly improving the user experience.
