# IATI Migration - Final Version with All Fixes

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### 1. âœ… View Dependency Error
**Error**: `cannot drop column objectives of table activities because other objects depend on it`
**Fix**: Added step to drop and recreate the `activities_with_reporting_org` view

### 2. âœ… Missing Column Error  
**Error**: `column a.activity_scope does not exist`
**Fix**: Updated migration to dynamically build view based on actual columns in the table

## Final Migration Approach

The migration now:
1. **Drops the dependent view** before making schema changes
2. **Dynamically detects columns** that exist in your activities table
3. **Recreates the view** with only existing columns (excluding removed ones)
4. **Handles all cases** whether columns exist or not

## ðŸš€ Steps to Complete Migration

### 1. (Optional) Check Current Schema
Run this first to see what columns you currently have:
```sql
-- Copy from: frontend/sql/check_activities_columns.sql
```

### 2. Run the Final Migration
```sql
-- Copy from: frontend/sql/migrate_activities_iati_compliance.sql
```

The migration will:
- âœ… Handle the view dependency automatically
- âœ… Only process columns that actually exist
- âœ… Create a view with the correct schema for your database
- âœ… Add organization display fields
- âœ… Backfill organization names

### 3. Verify Success
After running the migration, check:
- The view was recreated successfully
- No error messages in the output
- Run the verification query at the end

## Key Features of Final Migration

1. **Smart Column Detection**: The view recreation uses dynamic SQL to only include columns that exist
2. **Safe Operations**: All operations use IF EXISTS/IF NOT EXISTS
3. **No Manual Editing Required**: The migration adapts to your actual schema

## What Gets Changed

### Removed (if they exist):
- `objectives` column
- `target_groups` column

### Renamed (if needed):
- `created_by_org` â†’ `reporting_org_id`

### Added (if not already present):
- `created_by_org_name` (for UI display)
- `created_by_org_acronym` (for UI display)

### View Updated:
- `activities_with_reporting_org` - Recreated without removed columns

## Success Indicators
- Migration completes without errors
- View `activities_with_reporting_org` exists and is queryable
- Application works without field errors
- Organization info displays correctly in UI

## Next Steps After Migration
1. Test creating a new activity in the UI
2. Test editing an existing activity
3. Verify organization names display correctly
4. Check analytics dashboards still work

The migration is now robust and will handle your specific database schema correctly!
