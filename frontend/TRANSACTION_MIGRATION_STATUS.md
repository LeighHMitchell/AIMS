# Transaction Migration Status

## Current State (as of latest update)

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Database Migration**: The IATI-compliant transaction schema is successfully installed
   - All new columns exist (disbursement_channel, provider/receiver org fields, etc.)
   - Old transactions preserved with new UUID primary keys
   - Enum types created for IATI code lists

2. **Auto-Creation Feature**: Activities are automatically created for orphan transactions

3. **Activities Page**: Temporarily fixed by mapping UUID fields for compatibility

### ❌ What's Not Working:
1. **Schema Cache Issue**: PostgREST is still using cached old schema
   - Error: "Could not find the 'disbursement_channel' column"
   - This prevents new IATI transactions from being imported

### 🔧 To Fix the Schema Cache:

**Option 1: Database Restart (Recommended)**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database
2. Click "Restart database"
3. Wait 2-3 minutes
4. Refresh your application

**Option 2: Force Cache Clear**
In SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Terminate PostgREST connections
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE application_name = 'PostgREST';

-- Force reload
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

### 📋 After Cache is Fixed:

1. **Test Transaction Import**:
   - Go to /iati-import
   - Upload an IATI file with transactions
   - Activities will auto-create if missing
   - Transactions will import with all IATI fields

2. **Verify in Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM transactions 
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

3. **Transaction Features Available**:
   - Full IATI field support
   - Auto-creation of missing activities
   - Organization linking
   - Sector and geography classifications
   - Flow types, finance types, tied status
   - Humanitarian marker

### 🚨 Important Notes:

1. **UUID vs ID**: The transactions table now uses `uuid` instead of `id`. The API automatically maps this for frontend compatibility.

2. **Existing Data**: Your 8 existing transactions are preserved and migrated to the new structure.

3. **Organization References**: Organizations can be referenced by both ID and IATI reference codes.

4. **Field Mappings**: The import handles various IATI transaction type formats (numeric and text).
