# Transaction Display Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Provider/Receiver Organizations Showing as UUIDs

**Problem:** After saving, the "from" (provider_org) and "to" (receiver_org) fields were showing raw UUID values instead of organization names.

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced the `getOrgNameById` function in TransactionsManager to:
  - Show organization name if found in partners list
  - Show "Organization (uuid...)" if UUID not found in list
  - Show "-" if no value
  - Properly handle "Other" option
  - Handle legacy organization names

```typescript
// Before: Would show raw UUID
// After: Shows "World Bank (WB)" or "Organization (550e8400...)"
```

### 2. ✅ Transaction Data Structure Synchronization

**Problem:** Transaction fields might be missing when returned from backend, causing display issues.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added proper field defaults in useEffect to ensure all required fields exist:
  - `status` defaults to 'actual'
  - `currency` defaults to 'USD'
  - `transactionDate` defaults to today
  - Other fields get empty string defaults

### 3. ✅ No Filtering by Publication Status

**Verified:** Transactions are NOT filtered by publication status. The only filters are:
- Transaction type (C, D, E, etc.)
- Status (Draft/Actual)
- Date range

Publishing an activity should NOT hide transactions.

## What Was Already Working

- ✅ Transactions save correctly to Supabase
- ✅ No filtering based on activity publication status
- ✅ Edit and delete functionality works properly
- ✅ Export functionality includes all transaction data

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Organization Display**
   - Add a transaction with provider/receiver organizations
   - Save the activity
   - Check that organization names display properly (not UUIDs)
   - If organization not in partners list, should show "Organization (uuid...)"

2. **Test Data Persistence**
   - Add multiple transactions
   - Save activity
   - Refresh page
   - All transactions should still be visible with proper formatting

3. **Test Publishing**
   - Add transactions to an activity
   - Publish the activity
   - Transactions should remain visible
   - No transactions should disappear

## Debugging Tips

### Check Partners List
In browser console:
```javascript
// Check if partners are loaded
const partnersElements = document.querySelectorAll('[role="option"]');
console.log('Partners loaded:', partnersElements.length);
```

### Monitor Transaction Data
Look for console logs:
- `[AIMS] Mapped transaction X:` - Shows data being saved
- `[AIMS] Successfully inserted transactions: X` - Confirms save
- `[TRANSACTION] Invalid provider org UUID` - UUID validation errors

## Known Limitations

1. **Organization Display**: If an organization was deleted from the system, its UUID will show as "Organization (uuid...)" instead of the name
2. **Legacy Data**: Old transactions with organization names (not UUIDs) will display as-is
3. **Real-time Updates**: Changes to organization names won't reflect in existing transactions until page refresh

## Next Steps

1. Consider caching organization data for better performance
2. Add organization name resolution at the API level
3. Implement real-time organization name updates
