# IATI Import Validation Workflow Fix

## Problem Summary

The IATI Import tool had issues where validation fixes (transaction assignments and code mappings) were not properly persisting, leaving the import blocked even after users fixed issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Transaction Assignment Not Persisting

**Problem**: When users assigned unlinked transactions to activities, the assignments were not properly reflected in the validation state.

**Solution**: Updated `handleTransactionAssignments` in `frontend/src/app/iati-import-enhanced/page.tsx` to:
- Recalculate `transactionsNeedingAssignment` count after applying assignments
- Remove `missing_activity` issues from validation issues when all transactions are assigned
- Update the summary state to reflect the new counts
- Show success toast notification

### 2. Code Mappings Not Persisting

**Problem**: When users mapped unmapped codes to system values, the mappings were not properly reflected and the import remained blocked.

**Solution**: Updated `handleCodeMappings` in `frontend/src/app/iati-import-enhanced/page.tsx` to:
- Apply mappings to transaction data immediately
- Clear mapped codes from the `unmappedCodes` object
- Recalculate `unmappedCodesCount` after applying mappings
- Remove `unmapped_code` issues from validation issues when all codes are mapped
- Update the summary state to reflect the new counts
- Show success toast notification

### 3. Code Mappings Not Applied During Import

**Problem**: The import API was only applying `transaction_type` mappings, ignoring other code type mappings.

**Solution**: Updated `/api/iati/import-enhanced/route.ts` to:
- Apply all code type mappings (flow_type, finance_type, aid_type, tied_status, disbursement_channel, sector_code)
- Handle code mappings from both `fixes.codeMappings` and top-level `codeMappings` field
- Use the mapped values when inserting transactions

### 4. View Details Integration

**Problem**: "View Details" buttons in ValidationSummaryPanel weren't connected to the fix modals.

**Solution**: Updated the `onViewDetails` handler to:
- Open `AssignTransactionsModal` when clicking "View Details" for unlinked transactions
- Open `MapCodesModal` when clicking "View Details" for unmapped codes

## User Flow

1. **Upload XML** → Parse and validate
2. **Validation Results** → Shows issues including unlinked transactions and unmapped codes
3. **Fix Issues**:
   - Click "View Details" or "Fix Issues" button
   - For unlinked transactions: AssignTransactionsModal opens
   - For unmapped codes: MapCodesModal opens
4. **Apply Fixes**:
   - Assignments/mappings are saved
   - Validation state is updated
   - Success toast shown
   - Issues are cleared from the summary
5. **Import Unblocked**:
   - Red blocking message disappears
   - "Import to Database" button becomes enabled
   - Import proceeds with all mappings applied

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Transaction assignments stored in `transactionAssignments` state
- Code mappings stored in `codeMappings` state
- Both are passed to the import API endpoint

### Validation State Updates
- `parseResult.summary.transactionsNeedingAssignment` - updated after assignments
- `parseResult.summary.unmappedCodesCount` - updated after mappings
- `parseResult.validationIssues` - filtered to remove resolved issues
- `parseResult.transactions` - updated with assignments and mapped codes
- `parseResult.unmappedCodes` - cleared as codes are mapped

### Import API
- Accepts `codeMappings` parameter
- Applies all code type mappings before inserting transactions
- Ensures data integrity by using mapped values

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see their fixes applied immediately
2. **Clear Progress**: Success toasts confirm actions were saved
3. **Unblocked Import**: Import button becomes available once all issues are resolved
4. **Data Integrity**: All mappings are properly applied during import
5. **Better UX**: Clear workflow from validation → fixing → import
