# Activity Log System Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The system-wide activity log was not displaying real user actions. Instead, it was either empty or showing placeholder data. The root cause was that activity logs were being saved to a JSON file instead of the database, while the frontend was trying to read from the database.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed ActivityLogger to Use Database
**File:** `frontend/src/lib/activity-logger.ts`
- Removed file-based logging (`saveLogToFile` function)
- Updated `logActivity` to always use the API endpoint
- Configured proper URL handling for server-side vs client-side calls
- Added environment variable support (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`)

### 2. Extended ActivityLogger with New Event Types
Added logging methods for:
- **Organization events:** `organizationCreated`, `organizationUpdated`, `organizationDeleted`
- **User management:** `userCreated`, `userUpdated`, `userDeleted`
- **Tag management:** `tagAdded`, `tagRemoved`

### 3. Updated Frontend Components
**Files:** `frontend/src/components/ActivityFeed.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/activity-logs/page.tsx`
- Enhanced `getActionIcon` function to show appropriate icons based on entity type
- Updated `getActionDescription` to handle new entity types (organization, user, tag)
- Icons now properly differentiate between creating users vs organizations

### 4. Added Logging to API Routes
**File:** `frontend/src/app/api/organizations/route.ts`
- Added ActivityLogger import
- Implemented logging for:
  - Organization creation (POST)
  - Organization updates (PUT)
  - Organization deletion (DELETE)
- Captures user information for audit trail

## Activity Log Database Schema
The `activity_logs` table stores:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- user_id (UUID, nullable)
- activity_id (UUID, nullable)
- action (TEXT) - The action type
- details (JSONB) - Contains:
  - entityType
  - entityId
  - activityTitle
  - user (id, name, role)
  - metadata (additional context)
- created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
```

## Supported Event Types

### Activities
- `create` - New activity created
- `edit` - Activity edited
- `delete` - Activity deleted
- `publish` / `unpublish` - Publication status changed
- `submit_validation` - Submitted for validation
- `validate` - Activity approved
- `reject` - Activity rejected
- `status_change` - Activity status changed

### Organizations
- `create` - Organization created
- `edit` - Organization updated
- `delete` - Organization deleted

### Users
- `create` - User account created
- `edit` - User details updated
- `delete` - User account deleted

### Partners
- `add_partner` - Partner organization added
- `update_partner` - Partner details updated

### Transactions
- `add_transaction` - Transaction added to activity
- `edit_transaction` - Transaction edited
- `delete_transaction` - Transaction removed

### Contacts
- `add_contact` - Contact added to activity
- `remove_contact` - Contact removed

### Tags
- `add_tag` - Tag added to activity
- `remove_tag` - Tag removed

## Security & Permissions
- **Super users** see all system-wide activity
- **Other users** see activity filtered by:
  - Actions they performed
  - Activities in their organization
  - Public actions (for tier users)

## Usage Example
```typescript
// In API route
import { ActivityLogger } from '@/lib/activity-logger';

// Log organization creation
await ActivityLogger.organizationCreated(newOrg, user);

// Log activity edit with specific field change
await ActivityLogger.activityEdited(
  activity, 
  user, 
  'status', 
  'draft', 
  'published'
);
```

## Testing the Fix
1. Create/edit/delete activities
2. Add/remove organizations
3. Modify user accounts
4. Check the dashboard - Latest Activity panel should show real-time updates
5. Visit `/activity-logs` for full audit trail

## Next Steps for Full Implementation
To complete the activity logging system, add logging to:
- [ ] User management routes (`/api/users`)
- [ ] Login/logout events (auth routes)
- [ ] Tag management
- [ ] Permission/role changes
- [ ] File uploads/downloads

## Environment Variables
Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set in `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
