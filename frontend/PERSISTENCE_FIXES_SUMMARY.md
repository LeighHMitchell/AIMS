# Data Persistence and UI Feedback Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Save Feedback
- **Added detailed success messages** showing exactly what was saved (e.g., "Saved: 1 transaction, 2 contacts")
- **Added loading spinners** on all save buttons ("Saving...", "Publishing...")
- **Added warning toasts** if data appears to be missing after save
- **Clear error messages** when save fails

### 2. ✅ Improved Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive logging for:
  - Contributor nominations
  - Transaction state changes
  - Pre-save state verification
  - Post-save data validation

### 3. ✅ Better Error Handling
- **Fixed false ID error messages** - errors are cleared when activity loads successfully
- **More specific error messages** for different failure types
- **Validation warnings** if expected data doesn't persist

### 4. ✅ Visual Loading States
- All save buttons show loading spinner and text
- Buttons are disabled during save operations
- Clear visual feedback that something is happening

## What You'll See Now

### When Adding Contributors:
1. Select organization → Click "Nominate"
2. See toast: "Organization X has been nominated as a contributor"
3. Check console for `[CONTRIBUTORS DEBUG]` logs

### When Adding Transactions:
1. Fill form → Click "Add Transaction"
2. See toast: "Transaction added successfully"
3. Transaction appears in list immediately
4. Check console for `[AIMS DEBUG] Transactions state changed`

### When Saving:
1. Click any save button → See spinner + "Saving..."
2. Success toast shows: "Activity saved successfully! Saved: 1 transaction, 1 contact"
3. If contributors didn't save, warning toast: "Contributors may not have saved properly"
4. Activity ID shown in toast description

## Known Issues Being Investigated

### Contributors Not Persisting
Based on logs, contributors are being added to UI but count is 0 when saving. This suggests:
- State update from ContributorsSection → parent component may be failing
- The `onChange` callback might not be updating parent state correctly

**To Debug:**
1. Open browser console
2. Add a contributor
3. Look for: `[CONTRIBUTORS DEBUG] onChange called with 1 contributors`
4. Click Save
5. Look for: `[AIMS DEBUG] Pre-save state check: - contributors count:`

### Transaction Display After Save
Transactions ARE saving (confirmed in logs) but may not display properly after navigation. This is likely a UI refresh issue, not a save issue.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new feedback** - You should see clear messages for all operations
2. **Check console logs** - Debug messages will help identify where data is lost
3. **Report findings** - Note which debug messages appear and their values
4. **Video any issues** - If problems persist, record with console open
