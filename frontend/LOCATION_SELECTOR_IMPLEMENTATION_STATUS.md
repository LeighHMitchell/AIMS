- [ ] Retry mechanisms work
- [ ] Invalid coordinate handling

## 🧪 **HOW TO TEST**

1. **Navigate to Activity Editor**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/activities/new
   ```

2. **Go to Locations Tab**
   - Click on "Locations" tab in activity editor

3. **Test Search**
   - Search for "Yangon" or "Mandalay"
   - Verify map centers on location

4. **Test Pin Dropping**

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Map Not Loading**
- Check console for Leaflet errors
- Verify CSS import in globals.css
- Ensure react-leaflet components are dynamic

### **Search Not Working**
- Check network tab for OpenStreetMap API calls
- Verify CORS settings
- Test with different location names

### **Autosave Issues**
- Check console for field API errors
- Verify activity ID is present
- Check database connection

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Heat Map Implementation** - Complete the heat map visualization
2. **Coverage Areas UI** - Add interface for administrative coverage areas
3. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize for large numbers of locations
4. **Mobile UX** - Improve mobile touch interactions
5. **Offline Support** - Add offline map tiles if needed

## 📝 **CURRENT STATUS**
