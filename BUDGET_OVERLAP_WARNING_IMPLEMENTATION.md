# Budget Overlap Warning Implementation

## Overview
Changed budget period overlap behavior from **blocking error** to **informational warning**. Users can now create overlapping budget periods, but they will receive clear visual warnings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Changes
**File**: `frontend/sql/remove_budget_overlap_trigger.sql`

- Created SQL script to remove the database trigger that prevented overlaps
- Dropped `prevent_budget_overlap` trigger
- Dropped `check_budget_period_overlap()` function
- Added table comment documenting the change

**To Apply**: Run this SQL against your Supabase database:
```bash
psql your_database < frontend/sql/remove_budget_overlap_trigger.sql
```

Or in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS prevent_budget_overlap ON activity_budgets;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS check_budget_period_overlap();
COMMENT ON TABLE activity_budgets IS 'Budget periods are allowed to overlap. The UI will show warnings to users when overlaps are detected.';
```

### 2. Frontend Validation Changes
**File**: `frontend/src/components/activities/ActivityBudgetsTab.tsx`

#### Modified Functions:

1. **`validateBudget()`**
   - Removed overlap checking
   - Now only validates critical fields (dates, required fields)
   - Overlaps no longer block saves

2. **Added `checkBudgetOverlap()`**
   - New function to detect overlapping budgets
   - Returns array of overlapping budgets for display
   - Does NOT block operations, only provides information

3. **`duplicateForward()`**
   - Removed blocking behavior on overlaps
   - Logs overlaps but allows creation
   - Console message notes overlaps are allowed

4. **`duplicateBudget()`**
   - Tries to find non-overlapping period first (preferred)
   - If no non-overlapping period exists, creates with same dates (allowed overlap)
   - No longer shows error alert

5. **`executeCopy()`**
   - Removed `copyOverlapWarning` from blocking condition
   - Overlap warning is now informational only

### 3. Visual Warning Indicators

Added prominent visual warnings for overlapping budget periods:

- **Row Highlighting**: Rows with overlapping periods have orange background (`bg-orange-50/30`)
- **Border Indicators**: Date input fields have orange borders when overlapping (`border-orange-300`)
- **Warning Icon**: Orange AlertCircle icon (⚠️) next to period start date
- **Tooltip Information**: Hover over warning icon to see:
  - "Period Overlap Warning" header
  - List of all overlapping budget periods with dates
  - Easy to identify which budgets conflict

### 4. Updated Warning Messages

Changed all occurrences of:
- **Old**: "Budget periods must not overlap"
- **New**: "Budget periods overlap (allowed, but not recommended)"

This appears in the copy/duplicate dialogs to inform users without blocking.

## User Experience

### Before:
❌ User creates budget with overlapping dates
❌ Error message: "Budget periods cannot overlap for the same activity"
❌ Save is blocked
❌ User must manually adjust dates

### After:
✅ User creates budget with overlapping dates
⚠️ Visual warning: Orange highlighting and icon with tooltip
✅ Save is allowed
✅ User can proceed with overlap if intentional, or adjust if accidental

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a budget period (e.g., Jan 1 - Mar 31)
- [ ] Create another budget with overlapping dates (e.g., Feb 1 - Apr 30)
- [ ] Verify:
  - [ ] Both budgets save successfully
  - [ ] Orange background appears on overlapping rows
  - [ ] Orange warning icon appears next to dates
  - [ ] Tooltip shows which budgets overlap
  - [ ] Date input borders are orange
- [ ] Test "Duplicate Forward" functionality
  - [ ] Should work even if it creates overlap
  - [ ] Warning should appear on the new row
- [ ] Test copy dialog
  - [ ] Should allow copying even with overlap warning
  - [ ] Warning message should say "allowed, but not recommended"

## Database Migration

The database trigger removal is **backward compatible** - it only removes restrictions, doesn't change schema.

### To Apply:
```bash
# Option 1: Via psql
psql your_connection_string -f frontend/sql/remove_budget_overlap_trigger.sql

# Option 2: Via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Copy contents of remove_budget_overlap_trigger.sql
# 3. Run the query
```

### Rollback (if needed):
If you need to restore the overlap prevention:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_budget_period_overlap()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM activity_budgets
    WHERE activity_id = NEW.activity_id
      AND id != COALESCE(NEW.id, '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'::uuid)
      AND (
        (NEW.period_start, NEW.period_end) OVERLAPS (period_start, period_end)
      )
  ) THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Budget periods cannot overlap for the same activity';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER prevent_budget_overlap
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON activity_budgets
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION check_budget_period_overlap();
```

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Users can model complex budget scenarios that require overlapping periods
2. **User Agency**: Users make the decision rather than being blocked by the system
3. **Awareness**: Clear visual warnings ensure users know when overlaps exist
4. **Better UX**: No frustrating error messages during data entry
5. **Real-world Modeling**: Some budget scenarios legitimately require overlaps (e.g., revised budgets, concurrent funding sources)

## Notes

- The visual warnings are prominent enough that users won't miss overlaps
- Overlaps might be intentional (e.g., showing original and revised budgets for same period)
- The system tried to find non-overlapping periods when duplicating, but allows overlaps as fallback
- All existing validation (date ranges, required fields) remains in place
