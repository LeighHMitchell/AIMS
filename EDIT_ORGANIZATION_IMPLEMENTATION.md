5. Implemented `handleEditSuccess` callback to refresh organization data after edits

```typescript
// Modal state
const [editModalOpen, setEditModalOpen] = useState(false)

// Button to open modal
<Button 
  className="bg-slate-600 hover:bg-slate-700"
  onClick={() => setEditModalOpen(true)}
>
  <Edit className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Edit Organization
</Button>

// Modal component
<EditOrganizationModal
  organization={organization}
  open={editModalOpen}
  onOpenChange={setEditModalOpen}
  onSuccess={handleEditSuccess}
/>
```

## Technical Details

### API Integration
- Uses existing PUT endpoint: `/api/organizations/[id]`
- Request body contains organization fields to update
- Returns updated organization data on success

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Edit Organization" button on profile page
2. Modal dialog opens with form pre-populated with current organization data
3. User makes changes to any fields
4. User clicks "Save Changes" or "Cancel"
5. If Save: API request sent to update organization
6. On success: 
   - Toast notification shown
   - Organization data refreshed
   - Modal closes automatically
7. On error: Error toast shown, modal remains open for retry
8. If Cancel: Modal closes without saving changes

### Dependencies Used
- Next.js 14 App Router
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Sonner (toast notifications)
- Shadcn UI components (Dialog, Button, Input, Select, Textarea, Label, ScrollArea)
- Lucide React icons (Building2, Save, Loader2)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `frontend/src/components/organizations/EditOrganizationModal.tsx` - Comprehensive tabbed modal component (1100+ lines)
  - Includes ImageUpload component with drag & drop
  - Myanmar-specific logic functions
  - Country and region data
  - Organization type defaults
  - 5 tabbed sections

- `frontend/sql/add_social_media_columns.sql` - Database migration to add social media columns
  - Adds: social_twitter, social_facebook, social_linkedin, social_instagram, social_youtube

### Modified:
- `frontend/src/app/organizations/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Added import for shared EditOrganizationModal
  - Added modal state management
  - Added onClick handler to button
  - Added modal component to page
  - Added handleEditSuccess callback function
  - Fixed loading state to prevent "Organization not found" flash

- `frontend/src/app/organizations/page.tsx`
  - Added import for shared EditOrganizationModal
  - Removed inline EditOrganizationModal definition (now uses shared component)
  - Re-added DeleteConfirmationModal component
  - Modal usage remains unchanged (same interface)

## Notes

- **Shared Component**: Both pages now use the same `EditOrganizationModal` component from `/components/organizations/`
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organized into 4 tabs for better UX and easier expansion:
  1. Basic Info - Essential identification fields
  2. Branding - Logo and banner image uploads
  3. Contact & Social - Email, phone, website, address, and all social media (with icons)
  4. Classification - IATI IDs and auto-calculated fields
- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Logo and banner images support drag & drop with preview
- **Myanmar-Specific Logic**: Auto-calculates Partner Origin and Classification based on organization type and location
- **Flexible Interface**: The modal supports both callback patterns:
  - `onSave` callback (used by organizations list page)
  - Direct API calls with `onSuccess` callback (used by organization profile page)
- Supports both `isOpen/onClose` and `open/onOpenChange` prop patterns for maximum compatibility
- Image uploads use base64 encoding for direct save (no separate file upload endpoint needed)
- All organization type options fetched from API and follow IATI standards
- Modal automatically refreshes organization data on successful save
- Always opens on "Basic Info" tab for consistency
- No page navigation required - provides better UX
- Field name compatibility: Handles both `organisation_type`/`Organisation_Type_Code` and `country`/`country_represented` naming variations

### Database Migration Required

To use social media fields, run the migration:
```sql
\i frontend/sql/add_social_media_columns.sql
```

This adds the following columns to the `organizations` table:
- `social_twitter`
- `social_facebook`
- `social_linkedin`
- `social_instagram`
- `social_youtube`
