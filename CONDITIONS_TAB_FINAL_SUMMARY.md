## 🔐 Security Features

### RLS Policies (Post-Audit)
✅ **Properly restricted** - Users can only modify conditions for activities that exist
✅ **Activity validation** - Checks activity existence before allowing changes
✅ **Follows pattern** - Consistent with other tables in the system

### Input Validation
✅ **Type validation** - Only allows valid IATI types (1, 2, 3)
✅ **Narrative validation** - Requires non-empty descriptions
✅ **Activity validation** - Prevents operations on unsaved activities
✅ **Database constraints** - Enforced at multiple levels

---

## 🎨 User Experience Features

### UI/UX
- ✅ Clean, intuitive interface
- ✅ Help tooltips with IATI descriptions
- ✅ Loading states on all buttons
- ✅ Success/error toast notifications
- ✅ Empty state with helpful prompts
- ✅ Inline editing
- ✅ Read-only mode support

### Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful handling of invalid data
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Prevents double submissions
- ✅ Validation feedback

---

## 📊 Technical Specifications

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Apply database migration
- [ ] Test manual condition creation
- [ ] Test condition editing
- [ ] Test condition deletion
- [ ] Test attached status toggle
- [ ] Test XML import with valid data
- [ ] Test XML import with invalid data
- [ ] Verify loading states work
- [ ] Verify validation prevents bad data
- [ ] Test with different user roles
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly

### Test Files
- `test_conditions_import.xml` - Comprehensive test file with:
  - 4 conditions (all 3 types)
  - Multi-language narratives
  - Valid IATI structure

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Database
```bash
# Apply migration
psql -h your-supabase-host -d postgres -f frontend/supabase/migrations/20250129000009_create_activity_conditions.sql
```

### 2. Frontend
```bash
# Already integrated - no additional steps needed
# Verify navigation shows "Conditions" under "Funding & Delivery"
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
# Navigate to activity editor → Conditions tab
# Import test_conditions_import.xml
# Verify all features work as expected
```

## 🎓 IATI Condition Types Reference

| Code | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Policy | Requires a particular policy to be implemented by the recipient |
| 2 | Performance | Requires certain outputs or outcomes to be achieved by the recipient |
| 3 | Fiduciary | Requires use of certain public financial management or public accountability measures by the recipient |

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Q: Conditions not showing after import**
A: Check browser console for errors, verify RLS policies applied

**Q: Can't add conditions to new activity**
A: This is by design - save the activity first

**Q: Some conditions skipped during import**
A: Check the import feedback - invalid types or empty descriptions are skipped

**Q: RLS policy errors**
A: Verify the migration was applied correctly
