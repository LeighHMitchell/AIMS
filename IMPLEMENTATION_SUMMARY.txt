   - Auto-save enabled

2. âœ… Created Collapsible "Advanced IATI Fields" Section
   - Located between "Supporting Documents" and "System Identifiers"
   - Globe icon + chevron that rotates on expand
   - Clean, organized layout

3. âœ… Added Single-Value Fields (inside collapsible):
   - Sector Code + Vocabulary dropdown
   - Recipient Country (2-char ISO code, auto-uppercase)
   - Recipient Region + Vocabulary dropdown
   - All with auto-save and tooltips

4. âœ… Integrated Multiple Element Managers (IATI compliant):

   - Multiple Aid Types (with vocabularies)
   - Multiple Countries (with % allocations)
   - Multiple Regions (with % allocations)
   - Tab-based UI for Countries/Regions with mutual exclusivity

Files Modified:

Key Features:
------------
- Auto-save on all single-value fields

Next Steps:
----------
1. Test the modal by creating/editing transactions
2. Verify fields save to database correctly
3. Check JSONB arrays for multiple elements
4. Test collapsible section expand/collapse
5. Verify auto-save works for all new fields
