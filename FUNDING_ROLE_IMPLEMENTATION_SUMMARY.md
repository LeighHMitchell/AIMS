## IATI Role Mapping

| Current Role | IATI Code | IATI Name | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `funding` | `1` | Funding | Organizations providing financial resources |
| `government` | `2` | Accountable | Responsible for ensuring objectives are met |
| `extending` | `3` | Extending | Extends funds to other entities |
| `implementing` | `4` | Implementing | Directly involved in execution |

## User Experience

Users now see 4 organization cards in the Activity Editor:
1. **Funding Partners** - For organizations providing financial resources
2. **Extending Partners** - For organizations that channel funds
3. **Implementing Partners** - For organizations executing activities
4. **Government Partners** - For government entities overseeing activities

## Benefits

1. **Full IATI Compliance**: All 4 IATI role types are now supported
2. **Automatic Role Assignment**: Role is automatically assigned based on which card the user selects
