# Quick Start Guide - Organization Profile Visualizations

## üöÄ How to See the New Visualizations on Localhost

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The server should start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Navigate to Organization Profiles

#### Option A: Via Organizations List
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/organizations`
2. Click on any organization to view its profile

#### Option B: Direct URL
If you know an organization ID, go directly to:
`http://localhost:3000/organizations/[organization-id]`

### 3. What You'll See

#### ‚úÖ Enhanced Dashboard (Hero Cards)
- **Financial Overview** (Blue): Total budget, expenditure, execution rate
- **Activity Portfolio** (Green): Total activities, status breakdown, role distribution
- **Geographic Reach** (Purple): Countries, primary country, organization type
- **Experience** (Orange): Years active, established date, avg project value

#### ‚úÖ New Visualization Tabs
1. **Timeline Tab**: Activity portfolio timeline (Gantt chart)
2. **Geography Tab**: Geographic footprint with country breakdown
3. **Partnerships Tab**: Partnership network analysis
4. **Sectors Tab**: Sector allocation donut chart

### 4. Troubleshooting

#### If you see errors about missing components:
The components have TypeScript errors that won't prevent the app from running but might show warnings in the console. The visualizations should still display correctly.

#### If data appears empty:
- Some visualizations depend on having activities, budgets, and transactions data
- The components gracefully handle missing data and show appropriate empty states
- Sample data is provided for testing purposes

#### If the server won't start:
```bash
# Clean install
cd frontend
npm run clean:all

# Or just clean build
npm run clean
npm run dev
```

### 5. Testing with Sample Data

The organization profile page includes sample data for:
- Budgets (if API fails)
- Expenditures (if API fails)
- Documents (if API fails)

This ensures you can see the visualizations even without complete backend data.

### 6. Key Features to Test

#### Dashboard Cards
- Hover over progress bars and badges
- Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes

#### Timeline Visualization
- Scroll through activities if there are many
- Look for the red current date indicator
- Check color coding by activity status

#### Geographic Footprint
- View country breakdown with activity counts
- Check role and status badges

#### Partnership Network
- Scroll through partner list
- View collaboration details and shared activities

#### Sector Allocation
- Interactive donut chart with hover tooltips
- Detailed legend with sector information
- Coverage statistics

### 7. Browser Developer Tools

Open browser dev tools (F12) to:
- Check console for any errors
- View network requests to APIs
- Test responsive design

### 8. Expected API Endpoints

The visualizations expect these endpoints to work:
- `/api/organizations/[id]` - Organization details ‚úÖ
- `/api/organizations/[id]/budgets` - Budget data ‚ö†Ô∏è (fallback to sample data)
- `/api/organizations/[id]/expenditures` - Expenditure data ‚ö†Ô∏è (fallback to sample data)
- `/api/organizations/[id]/transactions` - Transaction data ‚ö†Ô∏è (may not exist yet)
- `/api/partners` - All organizations ‚úÖ

### 9. Next Steps

If everything works well, you can:
1. **Add Real Data**: Populate your database with actual organization data
2. **Customize Colors**: Modify the color schemes in the components
3. **Add More Charts**: Implement the additional 10 recommended visualizations
4. **Export Features**: Add PDF/image export functionality
5. **Real-time Updates**: Add live data refresh capabilities

### 10. Performance Tips

For better performance with large datasets:
- Enable data pagination for large organization lists
- Implement lazy loading for heavy visualizations
- Add data caching for frequently accessed organization profiles
- Consider virtualization for long lists (partnerships, activities)

## üéØ Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Dashboard cards display with sample data
- [ ] Timeline shows activity bars (even if empty)
- [ ] Geography shows country information
- [ ] Partnerships handles empty state gracefully
- [ ] Sectors shows donut chart or empty state
- [ ] All tabs are clickable and switch content
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] No critical JavaScript errors in console

## üîß Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution**: The TypeScript errors won't prevent the app from running. These are compilation warnings that can be ignored for now.

### Issue: Charts not rendering
**Solution**: Check that `recharts` is installed and the browser supports the required features.

### Issue: Data not loading
**Solution**: Check browser network tab to see if API calls are successful. Components will show empty states if data is unavailable.

### Issue: Styling looks broken
**Solution**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is working properly and all UI components are installed.
