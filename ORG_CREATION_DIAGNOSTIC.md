# Organization Creation During XML Import - Diagnostic Guide

## Issue

Organizations imported from XML are showing AFDB logo, suggesting they're not being created as new organizations but are incorrectly matched to existing ones.

## Possible Causes

### 1. Organizations Already Exist
The organizations might have been created during a previous import but are linked to the wrong organization ID.

### 2. Organization Creation is Failing
The organization creation API might be failing due to:
- Duplicate name constraint (line 182-188 in organizations/route.ts)
- Missing required fields
- Database constraints

### 3. Matching is Still Fuzzy
Despite the fix, the search might still be returning AFDB as a match.

## How to Diagnose

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

When you import the XML, look for these specific log messages:

#### Scenario A: Organization is Being Matched (Wrong!)
```
[XML Import] Matched organization by IATI ref BB-BBB-123456789: African Development Bank
```
or
```
[XML Import] Matched organization by name Name of Agency B: African Development Bank
```

**Problem:** The matching is finding AFDB when it shouldn't
**Solution:** The exact match fix should prevent this, but verify the console logs

#### Scenario B: Organization Creation is Attempted
```
[XML Import] No exact match found for "Name of Agency B". Found 2 similar results but none matched exactly.
[XML Import] Creating new organization: Name of Agency B
[XML Import] New org data: { name: 'Name of Agency B', iati_org_id: 'BB-BBB-123456789', organisation_type: '40' }
```

Then either:
- ✅ **Success:** `[XML Import] Created new organization successfully: { id: '...', name: 'Name of Agency B', logo: 'NO LOGO' }`
- ❌ **Failure:** `[XML Import] Failed to create organization: { error: '...' }`

#### Scenario C: Organization Already Exists
```
[XML Import] Failed to create organization: { error: 'Organization with this name or acronym already exists' }
[XML Import] Organization already exists, searching again: ...
[XML Import] Found organization on retry: Name of Agency B
```

### Step 2: Check Organizations Database

Go to **Organizations** page in your AIMS system and search for:
- "Name of Agency B"
- "Name of Agency C"  
- "Name of Agency A"

**What you should see:**
- If they exist: 3 new organizations with no logos
- If they don't exist: Organizations weren't created (check console for why)

### Step 3: Check Participating Organizations Table

Go to **Participating Organisations** tab and look at the organizations:

**Currently showing:**
- AFDB logo/acronym (wrong!)

**After fix should show:**
- Organization name from XML
- No logo (or generic icon)
- Correct IATI identifier

## Solutions Based on Diagnosis

### Solution 1: Delete and Re-import (Recommended)

If organizations were matched to AFDB during first import:

1. **Delete participating organizations:**
   - Go to Participating Organisations tab
   - Delete all 3 organizations showing AFDB logo
   - This deletes the links, not the organizations themselves

2. **Re-import:**
   - Go to XML Import tab
   - Import the same XML
   - Watch console logs
   - Should create new organizations or match correctly

### Solution 2: Check for Duplicate Organizations

If organizations were created but look wrong:

**SQL Query to check:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  name, 
  acronym, 
  iati_org_id, 
  logo,
  organisation_type
FROM organizations
WHERE 
  name IN ('Name of Agency B', 'Name of Agency C', 'Name of Agency A')
  OR iati_org_id IN ('BB-BBB-123456789', 'CC-CCC-123456789', 'AA-AAA-123456789');
```

**Expected results:**
- 3 organizations with correct names
- No logo URL
- Correct IATI identifiers

### Solution 3: Force Create with Unique Names

If the API won't create orgs because of name conflicts, you can:

1. **Add timestamp to names** during import (temporary workaround)
2. **Remove duplicate check** from organizations API
3. **Manually create** the organizations first, then import

## Enhanced Logging Added

I've added comprehensive logging to help diagnose:

```typescript
console.log(`[XML Import] Creating new organization: ${orgData.narrative}`);
console.log(`[XML Import] New org data:`, { name, iati_org_id, organisation_type });
console.log(`[XML Import] Created new organization successfully:`, { id, name, logo });
```

## Quick Test

Try this to verify organizations are being created:

1. **Import your XML**
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Search for:** `"Created new organization successfully"`
4. **Check if you see 3 entries** (one for each org)
5. **Check the logo field** - should say "NO LOGO" or be undefined

If you see "Created new organization successfully" but they still show AFDB logo, then the issue is with the participating_organizations records pointing to the wrong organization_id.

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `frontend/src/components/activities/XmlImportTab.tsx` - Added retry logic and better logging

## Next Steps

1. **Check console logs** during import
2. **Share the console output** if organizations aren't being created
3. **Check Organizations page** to see if new orgs exist
4. **Delete incorrect participating org records** and re-import if needed

---

**TL;DR:** The AFDB logos mean the participating_organizations records are linked to AFDB's ID, not to newly created organizations. Delete the participating orgs and re-import with the fixed code.
