# Financing Terms Tab Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Financing Terms tab for the AIMS activity editor, supporting IATI `<crs-add>` data including loan terms, yearly loan status tracking, OECD CRS flags, and channel code display. The tab supports both manual data entry and XML import.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Database Schema ✅
**File**: `frontend/supabase/migrations/20250115000002_create_financing_terms.sql`

Created two tables:

- **`activity_financing_terms`**: Stores loan terms (1:1 with activities)
  - Fields: `rate_1`, `rate_2`, `repayment_type_code`, `repayment_plan_code`, `commitment_date`, `repayment_first_date`, `repayment_final_date`
  - JSONB field for `other_flags` (array of OECD CRS flags)
  - Unique constraint on `activity_id`
  - Full RLS policies

- **`activity_loan_status`**: Stores yearly loan status (1:many with activities)
  - Fields: `year`, `currency`, `value_date`, `interest_received`, `principal_outstanding`, `principal_arrears`, `interest_arrears`
  - Unique constraint on (`activity_id`, `year`)
  - Validation constraints on amounts and year range
  - Full RLS policies

- Updated triggers for `updated_at` timestamps
- Comprehensive indexes for performance

### 2. TypeScript Types ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/types/financing-terms.ts`

Defined comprehensive types:
- `RepaymentType`: '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' (IATI codes)
- `RepaymentPlan`: '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' (IATI codes)
- `OtherFlag`: interface for OECD CRS flags
- `LoanTerms`: Complete loan terms interface
- `LoanStatus`: Yearly loan status interface
- `FinancingTerms`: Combined interface
- `FinancingTermsTabProps`: Component props
- Label and description constants

### 3. Data Files ✅
**Files**: 
- `frontend/src/data/oecd-crs-flags.ts` - OECD CRS flag definitions
- `frontend/src/data/repayment-types.ts` - IATI repayment type codes (1-4)
- `frontend/src/data/repayment-plans.ts` - IATI repayment plan codes (1-4)

Each data file includes:
- Full code definitions with names and descriptions
- Helper functions for lookups
- Dropdown option generators

### 4. Custom Hook ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/hooks/use-financing-terms.ts`

Implemented full CRUD operations:
- `useFinancingTerms(activityId)`: Main hook
- `fetchFinancingTerms()`: Load loan terms and all loan status entries
- `saveLoanTerms(data)`: Upsert loan terms
- `createLoanStatus(data)`: Insert yearly entry
- `updateLoanStatus(id, data)`: Update existing entry
- `deleteLoanStatus(id)`: Remove yearly entry
- `hasCompletedData`: Computed boolean for green tick logic
- Proper loading states and error handling with toast notifications

### 5. Financing Terms Tab Component ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/components/activities/FinancingTermsTab.tsx`

Full-featured UI component with four sections:

#### a) Loan Terms Section
- Rate 1 and Rate 2 inputs (percentage)
- Repayment Type dropdown (Equal Principal, Annuity, Lump sum, Other)
- Repayment Plan dropdown (Annual, Semi-annual, Quarterly, Other)
- Commitment Date, First Repayment Date, Final Repayment Date pickers
- Auto-save functionality
- Help text tooltips for each field
- Green checkmark when saved

#### b) Loan Status Section (Yearly Table)
- Table with columns: Year, Currency, Value Date, Interest Received, Principal Outstanding, Principal Arrears, Interest Arrears, Actions
- "Add Year" button to create new entries
- Inline form for adding yearly data
- Delete functionality with confirmation
- Sorted by year descending
- Empty state with helpful message

#### c) OECD CRS Flags Section
- Multi-checkbox selection for CRS flags (Free-standing technical cooperation, Programme-based approach, Investment project, Associated financing)
- Code and description display
- Saved with loan terms

#### d) Channel Code Section (Read-Only)
- Displays CRS channel code from primary participating organisation
- Tooltip explaining data source
- Helpful message if no channel code available

Features:
- Loading states
- Read-only mode support
- Green checkmark indicators when saved
- Empty states with guidance
- Error handling and validation
- Activity must be saved before adding financing terms

### 6. Navigation Integration ✅

#### a) ActivityEditorNavigation ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/components/ActivityEditorNavigation.tsx`
- Added "Financing Terms" to "Funding & Delivery" section
- Positioned between "Capital Spend" and "Conditions"

#### b) New Activity Page ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/app/activities/new/page.tsx`
- Imported `FinancingTermsTab` component
- Added `financingTermsCount` state
- Added case in `SectionContent` switch for "financing-terms"
- Fetch financing terms on activity load
- Added to `tabCompletionStatus` with green tick logic
- Added to `useMemo` dependencies
- Added to `navigationGroups`

#### c) Activity Detail Page ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/app/activities/[id]/page.tsx`
- Imported `FinancingTermsTab` component
- Added `TabsContent` for "financing-terms"

### 7. Green Tick Completion Logic ✅
Implemented smart completion tracking:
- Green tick appears when:
  - Loan terms exist with at least `rate_1` AND `commitment_date`, OR
  - At least one loan status entry exists
- Real-time updates via callback
- Integrated with tab completion status system

### 8. XML Import - Parser ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/app/api/iati/parse/route.ts`

Added CRS-add data extraction:
- Added `financingTerms` field to `ParsedActivity` interface
- Parse `<loan-terms>` element:
  - Attributes: `@_rate-1`, `@_rate-2`
  - Child elements: `<repayment-type>`, `<repayment-plan>`, `<commitment-date>`, `<repayment-first-date>`, `<repayment-final-date>`
- Parse `<other-flags>` elements (multiple, as array)
  - Attributes: `@_code`, `@_significance`
- Parse `<loan-status>` elements (multiple, one per year)
  - Attributes: `@_year`, `@_currency`, `@_value-date`
  - Child elements: `<interest-received>`, `<principal-outstanding>`, `<principal-arrears>`, `<interest-arrears>`
- Parse `<channel-code>` (for reference)

### 9. XML Import - Import Logic ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/app/api/iati/import-enhanced/route.ts`

Added Step 1b: Import financing terms after activities
- Check if `activity.financingTerms` exists
- Upsert loan terms to `activity_financing_terms` table
  - Uses `onConflict: 'activity_id'` for upsert
  - Includes `other_flags` as JSONB
- Upsert loan status entries to `activity_loan_status` table
  - Uses `onConflict: 'activity_id,year'` for yearly upsert
  - Loops through all yearly entries
- Error handling and logging

### 10. XML Import - UI Integration ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/components/activities/XmlImportTab.tsx`

Added financing terms display in field comparison:
- **Loan Terms**: Shows summary of rates, repayment type, and commitment date
- **Loan Status (Yearly)**: Shows count of yearly entries
- **OECD CRS Flags**: Shows list of flag codes
- All marked as `selected: true` by default
- Displayed in "finances" tab section
- Uses IATI path `iati-activity/crs-add/*`
