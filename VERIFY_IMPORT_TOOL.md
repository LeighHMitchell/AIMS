# Verifying the Smart Import Tool

## Quick Test URLs

1. **Direct Demo Page (No Login Required)**: 
   - Navigate to: `/import-demo`
   - This should show the full import functionality without needing to log in

2. **After Login**:
   - Go to `/login`
   - Use Dev Mode and select any user
   - After login, check the sidebar - it should say "Smart Import Tool üöÄ" (with rocket emoji)

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you're seeing "bulk import" instead of "Smart Import Tool", try these steps:

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or open Developer Tools ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Check "Disable cache"

### 2. Check the Console
Open browser console (`F12`) and look for any errors or messages that might indicate old code is being served.

### 3. Verify Files Are Updated
The sidebar text is in: `frontend/src/components/layout/main-layout.tsx` (line ~106)
It should say: `Smart Import Tool üöÄ`

### 4. Check Next.js Build
If running locally:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Look for any build errors in the terminal.

### 5. Direct Component Test
The import functionality exists at these URLs:
- `/import` - Main import page
- `/import/activities` - Activities import
- `/import/organizations` - Organizations import
- `/import/transactions` - Transactions import

## What You Should See

### In the Sidebar (after login):
- Dashboard
- **Smart Import Tool üöÄ** ‚Üê This should be visible
- Activities
- Organizations
- etc.

### On the Import Page:
- Title: "Smart Import Tool"
- 3 cards for Activities, Organizations, and Transactions
- Each card should be clickable

### In the Import Wizard:
1. **Upload Step**: Drag & drop file upload area with "Download Template" button
2. **Mapping Step**: Two-column layout with draggable fields
3. **Results Step**: Summary of imported data

## Features to Test

1. **File Upload**: Try dragging a CSV file to the upload area
2. **Download Template**: Click the button to get a sample CSV
3. **Field Mapping**: Drag columns from right to left
4. **Auto-Match**: Click the "Auto-Match" button
5. **Save Template**: Map some fields and save as a template
6. **Progress Bar**: Should appear during import

If you're still seeing old UI, the issue might be:
- Browser caching
- Local development server needs restart
- Build artifacts need clearing
- CDN caching (if deployed)
