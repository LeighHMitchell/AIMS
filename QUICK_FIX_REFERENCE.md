# Quick Fix Reference - Participating Organization Modal

## What Was Broken
1. ❌ Organization Role dropdown was empty
2. ❌ CRS Code "000000" wasn't available
3. ❌ French narrative wasn't showing
4. ❌ Advanced fields were empty

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Role now displays correctly (e.g., "3 Extending")
2. ✅ CRS Code "000000 Not specified" now available
3. ✅ Multilingual narratives load and display
4. ✅ All advanced fields populate from database

## Files Changed
- `OrganisationsSection.tsx` - passes all fields to modal
- `ParticipatingOrgModal.tsx` - handles narratives array safely
- `iati-crs-channel-codes.ts` - added "000000" code
- `use-participating-organizations.ts` - updated interface

## Test It
1. Refresh your browser
2. Click "Edit" on Agency A
3. Expand "Advanced IATI Fields"
4. You should now see:
   - ✅ Role: "3 Extending"
   - ✅ CRS Code: "21000 International NGO"
   - ✅ Multilingual Names: French "Nom de l'agence A"
   - ✅ Activity ID: "AA-AAA-123456789-1234"

## Debug
Check browser console for:
```
[OrganisationsSection] Editing org data: {...}
```

This shows the data being passed to the modal.
