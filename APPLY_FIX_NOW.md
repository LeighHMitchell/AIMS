No code changes needed.  
No deployment needed.

## What if I get errors?

### "relation already exists"
âœ… **Safe to ignore** - means table was already created

### "duplicate key value"
âœ… **Safe to ignore** - means some rates already existed

### Still seeing "No exchange rate available"?
1. Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify table was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exchange_rates;
   ```
   Should return: 108 (or more)
